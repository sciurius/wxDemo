Wx::Demo is a separate package for the wxPerl demo, previously bundled
with the wxPerl distribution. It has stalled since 2014.

**This is an independent fork.** It is created for my own purposes,
because I hate to see it rust away in the archives. I will add
features that I need. PRs for other features are welcome.

# INSTALLATION

`    perl Makefile.PL`  
`    make`  
`    make test`  
`    make install` (optional)

The demo program will be installed and executable with
`wxperl-demo.pl`.

To run the demo without installing:

`    perl bin/wxperl-demo.pl`
